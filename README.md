# NER for Nepali Sentences using OpenAI GPT-4

This repository presents a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system for Nepali sentences using the **OpenAI GPT-4** model. The system performs entity recognition on Nepali text, identifying entities such as persons, locations, organizations, dates, and other important terms within a sentence.

## Overview

The NER model is based on the **OpenAI GPT-4** (a powerful large language model) and has been evaluated using a training and testing set of Nepali sentences. In addition to the traditional evaluation metrics, the system also incorporates a **self-verification** mechanism to verify the accuracy of the LLM output. This ensures that the model's predictions are more reliable and relevant.

## Features

- **NER for Nepali**: Recognizes named entities in Nepali sentences, such as people, locations, organizations, dates, and more.
- **OpenAI GPT-4 Model**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 for generating predictions and handling complex language understanding tasks.
- **Self-Verification**: Implements a self-verification technique to cross-check the accuracy of the model's predictions. This step improves the reliability of the NER results.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using a train-test split, with performance metrics to assess its accuracy and effectiveness.
